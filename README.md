# Sublme Symbols: White Thymos in Alt-Right Corecore Edits
The following is a repository for my (in-progress) research on inductively identifying and cataloguing recurrent symbols in alt-right TikTok edits. 
I am particularly motivated by similar work which has been done to [catalogue textual dog-whistles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SALT-NLP/silent_signals_detection).

## Overview:
- I am working with 1492~ videos scraped from tiktok, around 900 of which were taken from hashtags associated with the alt-right. The other 600~ are from the corecore tag generally
- I am also working with around 25k comments, or 10-20 per video.
- I view this as a computational social scientific and cultural analytic work. Contained is my notebook of code (so far) and draft project proposal.
- The notebook is building towards a "topic modeling" pipeline which will cluster images via some combination of multimodal embeddings, dimensionality reduction, and density based clustering algorithms.
